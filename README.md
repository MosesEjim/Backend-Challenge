# Backend-Challenge
This is my Backend Challenge solution
The link to the APIs are:
root: https://requests-challenge.herokuapp.com/
post BuyRequests: https://requests-challenge.herokuapp.com/api/requests/buy/create
post SellRequests: https://requests-challenge.herokuapp.com/api/requests/sell/create
get BuyRequests or SellRequests: https://requests-challenge.herokuapp.com/api/requests/:type
type is either "buy" for BuyRequests or "sell" for SellRequests
'Note': "device_condition is either: 'A1', 'A2', 'B1', 'B2', 'C', 'C/B', 'C/D'"
